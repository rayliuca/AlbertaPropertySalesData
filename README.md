# AlbertaPropertySalesData
A program that uses Selenium to scrape the Alberta Government's Spin 2 system to gather data on property sales history

This is a work in progress...

(The scraping part works, but Spin 2 only returns limited results at a time within the specified criteria (not record fits the search will be returned). Will need to implement a grid sweep system)
